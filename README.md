# TimeTracker2021
Automatic time tracker

This Python program monitors automatically user's active window in 5 second intervals. This means that
window has to be on top for at least 5 seconds.

The information is written in a text file that will be created in C:\Users\user_name\.timetrackerlogs.
File is updated once per minute.


This initial version is based upon Jacob Vlijm's Linux version, which can be found at
